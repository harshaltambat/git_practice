Sequential Agents / State Management:\n#    - The consultation is broken into 6 explicit, mandatory steps defined in \n#      QUESTION_SEQUENCE.\n#    - The agent uses a 'current_step' variable to track progress and ensures \n#      questions are asked strictly in order, creating a highly structured user \n#      experience (Concept 1).\n#\n# 2. Tools (Built-in: Google Search Grounding):\n#    - The final plan generation step explicitly uses Google Search to ground \n#      calorie and macro recommendations in real-time nutritional science and \n#      latest dietary standards (Concept 2).\n#\n# 3. Sessions & Memory (Context Compaction):\n#    - Instead of feeding the entire, verbose chat history to the LLM for the \n#      final report, the user's key answers are collected and summarized via \n#      'compact_context()'.\n#    - This compacted profile ensures the final plan is generated efficiently, \n#      saving tokens, and minimizing conversational noise (Concept 3).\n#\n# EXECUTION FLOW:\n# 1. Initialization: The script sets up API keys and question lists.\n# 2. Conversation Loop: The agent iterates through the 6 steps, storing key data \n#    in memory ('user_answers').\n# 3. Finalization: Once all steps are complete, the 'user_answers' are compacted \n#    and the LLM is prompted (with Google Search enabled) to generate the final \n#    detailed plan.\n# ==============================================================================\n\n# --- Configuration ---\n# NOTE: Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Gemini API key.\nGOOGLE_API_KEY = \"GOOGLE_API_KEY\" \ntry:\n    GOOGLE_API_KEY = UserSecretsClient().get_secret(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\")\n    os.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = GOOGLE_API_KEY\n    print(\"✅ Gemini API key setup complete.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\n        f\"🔑 Authentication Error: Please make sure you have added 'GOOGLE_API_KEY' to your Kaggle secrets.

This plan is data-driven, prioritizing a sustainable calorie deficit and high-protein intake to preserve muscle mass and enhance satiety.\n\n---\n\n## **Section 1: Summary & Estimated Metrics**\n\nYour personalized plan is built upon a calculated calorie target that promotes safe and sustainable weight loss of approximately 0.5 kg (1 lb) per week.\n\n### **Estimated Energy Expenditure & Calorie Target**\n\n| Metric | Calculation / Rationale | Estimated Value |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **BMR** (Basal Metabolic Rate) | Energy burned at rest. | ~1283 kcal/day |\n| **TDEE** (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) | BMR $\\times$ Activity Factor (1.55 for Moderately Active). | ~1990 kcal/day |\n| **Estimated Calorie Deficit** | TDEE minus a safe and sustainable 500 kcal/day deficit. | 500 kcal/day |\n| **Target Calorie Intake** | **Your Weight Loss Goal** | **~1500 kcal/day** |\n\n***Note:*** *A 1500 kcal target is a safe and effective starting point for weight loss for women, as it is well above the minimum recommendation of 1,200 kcal/day.*\n\n### **Personalized Macro Goals**\n\nAs a moderately active woman over 50 on a vegetarian diet, a higher protein intake is critical for muscle preservation and satiety, which directly supports weight loss.\n\n| Macronutrient | Percentage of Total Calories | Estimated Daily Grams | Rationale |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Protein** | **30%** (450 kcal) | **~113 grams** | High-end target for older adults on a plant-based diet to maximize muscle health and fullness. |\n| **Fats** | **25%** (375 kcal) | **~42 grams** | Focus on healthy fats (nuts, seeds, avocado, olive oil) for hormone health and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. |\n| **Carbohydrates** | **45%** (675 kcal) | **~169 grams** | Focus on complex, high-fiber carbs (whole grains, legumes, vegetables) for sustained energy. |\n\n---\n\n## **Section 2: Personalized 7-Day Meal Plan**\n\nThis 3-day sample menu is **vegetarian**, **excludes eggs and non-veg**, is **high in protein**, and is designed with **quick prep** in mind to keep your total daily cooking time close to the 1-hour limit.\n\n| Meal | Day 1 (Prep-Ahead Focus) | Day 2 (Quick & Fresh) | Day 3 (Indian-Inspired) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Breakfast** (Prep: 5-10 min) | **High-Protein Yogurt Bowl:** 1 cup plain Greek Yogurt (or high-protein plant-based alternative), 1/2 cup mixed berries, 2 Tbsp chopped walnuts, drizzle of honey. | **Oatmeal Power Bowl:** 1/2 cup rolled oats cooked with water/skim milk, 1 scoop unflavored/vanilla protein powder mixed in, 1 Tbsp chia seeds, 1/2 sliced banana. | **Moong Dal Chilla (Savory Pancake):** 1-2 small chillas made from soaked/blended moong dal batter, served with a small bowl of mint/coriander chutney. |\n| **Lunch** (Prep: 15-20 min) | **Quick Black Bean & Quinoa Bowl:** 1/2 cup cooked quinoa, 1/2 cup black beans, mixed greens, chopped bell pepper, salsa, and 1/4 avocado (pre-cooked quinoa/beans are excellent for meal prep). | **White Bean & Avocado Sandwich:** Mash 1/2 cup canned white beans with lemon juice, herbs, and seasonings. Spread on 2 slices of whole-wheat bread with lettuce and 1/4 avocado. | **Herb Paneer Salad:** 100g grilled/pan-fried paneer cubes, mixed with chopped cucumber, tomatoes, bell peppers, and a lemon-herb dressing. |\n| **Dinner** (Prep: 25-30 min) | **Veggie Protein Chili (Batch Cook):** A bowl of chili made with mixed beans, lentils, sweet potato, and vegetable broth. Top with a dollop of low-fat sour cream or Greek yogurt. | **Teriyaki Tofu Stir-fry:** 100g pan-fried tofu cubes with a simple teriyaki sauce, served with 1 cup of steamed broccoli and 1/2 cup of brown rice. | **Tofu & Broccoli Green Curry:** Quick green curry made with firm tofu, broccoli, green beans, and light coconut milk (pre-chopped veggies save time). Serve with a small portion of brown rice. |\n| **Optional Snack** (If needed to meet 1500 kcal/protein goal) | 1/4 cup dry roasted chickpeas OR 1 cup low-fat cottage cheese (if dairy is consumed). | 1 apple with 1 Tbsp peanut/almond butter. | Handful of walnuts and 1 cup of black coffee or green tea. |\n\n---\n\n## **Section 3: Hydration and Activity Recommendations**\n\n### **Hydration Recommendations**\n\n*   **Target Intake:** Aim for a minimum of **2.5 - 3.0 liters (85-100 ounces) of water per day**. This is essential for metabolism, satiety, and energy levels during weight loss.\n*   **Timing:** Drink one large glass of water (8-10 oz) immediately upon waking and another 20-30 minutes before each main meal. This can help manage appetite and prevent overeating.\n*   **Variety:** Include herbal teas (unsweetened) or water infused with lemon, mint, or cucumber to make hydration more enjoyable.\n\n### **Activity Recommendations**\n\nYour current activity level is **Moderately Active** (3-5 days per week of moderate activity). To maximize weight loss, focus on consistency and incorporating both cardio and strength training.\n\n1.  **Cardiovascular Exercise (Fat Burning):** Maintain your current activity, aiming for **30-45 minutes, 5 days a week**. This can be brisk walking, cycling, or swimming.\n2.  **Strength Training (Muscle Preservation):** Incorporate **2-3 sessions per week** of resistance exercise. This is crucial for your age group to maintain muscle mass while losing weight. Focus on compound movements using bodyweight, resistance bands, or light dumbbells (e.g., squats, lunges, push-ups against a wall, and resistance band rows).\n3.  **NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis):** Look for small ways to move more, such as taking the stairs, parking further away, or standing while taking phone calls. These small movements contribute significantly to your daily calorie expenditure.\n\n---\n\n## **Section 4: Key Wellness Tips**\n\nHere are three actionable steps tailored to your specific profile and goal:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Plant-Based Protein at *Every* Meal:** For a vegetarian on a calorie deficit, hitting the protein target of **~113 grams** is paramount to maintain muscle and feel full. Since you dislike eggs, focus on high-protein plant sources like **tofu, tempeh, lentils, chickpeas, beans, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, and protein powder**. For example, add a scoop of protein powder to your morning oatmeal or yogurt bowl, and always pair a legume/soy source with your lunch and dinner.\n2.  **Master the 1-Hour Prep Strategy:** To fit the 1-hour constraint, dedicate a short time (e.g., 60-90 minutes) once or twice a week to **\"Power Prep.\"** This involves cooking staples like a large batch of quinoa/brown rice, soaking and boiling a pot of lentils/beans, and chopping vegetables (broccoli, bell peppers). Having these components ready drastically reduces daily assembly time for bowls, salads, and stir-fries.\n3.  **Focus on Fiber-Rich Whole Foods:** Plant-based diets are naturally high in fiber, which is a significant asset for weight loss, as it increases satiety and stabilizes blood sugar. Pair your protein sources with high-fiber complex carbohydrates like **whole grains (oats, brown rice, whole-wheat bread)** and a variety of **vegetables** to maximize fullness and nutrient intake on a lower calorie budget.\n\n=============== End of Plan ===============\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
